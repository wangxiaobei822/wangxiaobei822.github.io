Here is Xiaobei Wang(王潇北)’s Page. I’m currently a graduate student in [College of Engineering(工学院)](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University(北京大学)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) , supervised by [Prof. Guangming Xie(谢广明)](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/all_time/7139.html). My research interest mainly include Deep Reinforcement Learning, AI for Finance, Recommender Systems, Data Mining and LLM(Large Language Model).

During my journey in Peking university, I focus on developing robust, efficient and practical reinforcement learning algorithms for recommender systems. I am also interested in the application of deep learning and reinforcement learning in practical Finance or Economics problems like Financial Text Analysis and Stock Image Forecasting.
