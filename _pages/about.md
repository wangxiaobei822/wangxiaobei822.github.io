<span style="font-family: Helvetica"> Here is Xiaobei Wang(王潇北)’s Page. I’m currently a graduate student in [College of Engineering(工学院)](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University(北京大学)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) , supervised by [Prof. Guangming Xie(谢广明)](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/all_time/7139.html). My research interest mainly include Deep Reinforcement Learning, AI for Finance, Recommender Systems, Data Mining and LLM(Large Language Model).</span>

During my journey in Peking university, I was a member of [Intelligent Biomimetic Design Lab(北京大学智能仿生设计实验室)](https://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn) advised by [Prof. Guangming Xie(谢广明)](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/all_time/7139.html), focusing on developing robust, efficient and practical reinforcement learning algorithms for recommender systems. I also joined [FinLab(北京大学金融工程实验室)](finlab.pku.edu.cn) advised by [Prof. Shaoran Li(李少然)](http://lishaoran.com) and [Prof. Xinping Li(黎新平)](https://econ.pku.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/ybjs/sjrxx/374743.htm), exploring application of deep learning and reinforcement learning in practical Finance or Economics problems.

Projects
======
- **[Future Impact Decomposition in Request-level Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16108)** (Work was done at Kuaishou Technology & Intelligent Biomimetic Design Lab in Peking University)<br>
  ![](../images/item.png)
  - We specify the challenge of inconsistency between users' item-wise view and the recommender system's list-wise view. To solve the challenges mentioned above, we propose an item-decomposed advantage actor-critic framework and verify its superiority on multiple public datasets and an online A/B test.<br>
  - The paper is submitted to KDD 2024(Ads track)
  
  
  

- **Value Function Decomposition in Markov Recommendation Process** (Work was done at Kuaishou Technology & Intelligent Biomimetic Design Lab in Peking University)<br>
  ![](../images/TD.png)
  - We specify the challenge of sub-optimal TD learning under the mixed random factors from policy and user environment and propose a decomposed TD learning framework that separately addresses the two random factors and empirically shows its superiority in online MRP. <br>
  - The paper is submitted to KDD 2024(research track)

- **Financial Text Analysis and Stock Image Forecasting** (Work was done at Finlab in Peking University)<br>

  - We conduct a research project merging ML, NLP to analyze the impact of news text on multiple stocks and investigate the correlation between textual information and stock performance.
  - We implement image analysis to generate stock Candlestick chart images, assessed different models for accuracy, and leveraged predictive factors to construct a profitable investment portfolio.

- **LLM(Large Language Model) for TikTok E-Commerce Network Broadcast** (Work was done at ByteDance)<br>
  - We prompt LLM to generate product titles based on product information.
  - we conduct research on the current status and key technologies of Chinese open-source large language models, such as ChatGLM.
  - We fine-tune a smaller version of the LLM with the dataset generated by LLM and collected live streaming text.





- **AutoScale: Automated Training and Evaluating Large-scale Models with Extendable Modules beyond 3D Parallel** (Work was done at Shanghai AI Lab)<br>
![](../images/AutoScale.png)
  - We propose a novel framework, AutoScale, getting rid of the dependence on the mathematical models of current auto parallel algorithms.
  - AutoScale consists of three extendable modules, namely Search Space, Cost Model, and Search Module, which regards the 3D Parallel from a unified formulation and utilizes paralleled search algorithms to scale search modules automatically.
